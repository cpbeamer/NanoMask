# NanoMask — Backlog

> **Status**: Phase 2 complete (3-stage pipeline + connection pooling ✅). Chunked SSN redaction (2.1) ✅ complete. Epic 3 (Configuration) ✅ complete. Epic 4.1 (TLS listener) ✅ complete. Phase 3 Epics 1-2 (remaining tickets), Phase 4 (remaining), and Phase 5 (Competitive Moat) are open.

---

## Phase 3 — Scalability

### Epic 1: IOCP / io_uring Event Loop

**Goal**: Replace `std.Thread.spawn` per connection with a `std.Io`-based event loop, scaling from 128 to 10,000+ concurrent connections.

**Context**: Zig 0.15.2 `std.Io` is the new cross-platform async I/O interface wrapping IOCP (Windows), io_uring (Linux), and kqueue (macOS). This is the idiomatic path forward.

> **In plain English:** Right now NanoMask creates a brand-new OS thread for every user that connects. Threads are expensive — the system chokes after ~128. This epic replaces that with a smarter "event loop" that juggles thousands of connections with just a few threads, the same approach used by high-performance servers like NGINX.

#### 1.1 — Spike: `std.Io` event loop with accept + echo

**Type**: Research / Spike  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Build a minimal TCP echo server using `std.Io` (non-blocking accept, read, write)
- Verify it compiles and runs on Windows (IOCP backend)
- Measure max concurrent connections vs. the current 128-thread model
- Document API surface, gotchas, and buffer ownership semantics

**Acceptance**: A standalone `spike_io.zig` that accepts 1,000+ concurrent connections and echoes data back.

> **In plain English:** A quick experiment to prove the new I/O technology works before investing days rewriting the proxy. Better to spend one day testing than one week building the wrong thing.

---

#### 1.2 — Extract `ConnectionHandler` interface

**Type**: Refactor  
**Estimate**: 0.5 day  
**Depends on**: None (can start immediately)

- Extract `handleConnection` from `src/main.zig` into a `ConnectionHandler` struct with a well-defined interface
- Decouple `ThreadContext` from thread-specific assumptions (stack buffers)
- Pass read/write interfaces instead of raw `std.net.Server.Connection`

**Acceptance**: The existing thread-per-connection model works identically but the handler is decoupled from the threading model.

> **In plain English:** Untangle the connection-handling logic from the threading code so we can swap out the underlying engine without rewriting the business logic. Like separating the engine from the car body — you can swap engines without redesigning the seats.

---

#### 1.3 — Implement `std.Io`-based accept loop

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 2 days  
**Depends on**: 1.1, 1.2

- Replace the `while (true) accept()` loop in `src/main.zig` with `std.Io`-based non-blocking accept
- Remove `std.Thread.spawn` and `active_connections` atomic counter
- Handle connection lifecycle (read head → process → write response → close) as I/O completion callbacks
- Configurable max connections (default 10,000)

**Acceptance**: `zig build run` starts the proxy in event-loop mode. Benchmark tool shows 1,000+ concurrent connections handled without thread exhaustion.

> **In plain English:** The main event — replace the old threading model with the event loop. This is the difference between maxing out at ~128 users and handling 10,000+. Also dramatically reduces memory usage since each thread carries ~1 MB of overhead.

---

#### 1.4 — Graceful shutdown and connection draining

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 0.5 day  
**Depends on**: 1.3

- Handle `SIGINT` / `CTRL+C` to stop accepting new connections
- Drain in-flight connections before exiting
- Clean up GPA (currently unreachable due to infinite loop)

**Acceptance**: `Ctrl+C` triggers clean shutdown with "draining N connections" log message. No memory leaks.

> **In plain English:** When you stop the proxy, instead of cutting everyone off mid-request, it finishes the in-progress work first. Essential for deploying updates without losing anyone's data.

---

### Epic 2: Streaming Chunked Redaction

**Goal**: Process request bodies in fixed-size chunks instead of buffering the entire payload. Critical for multi-MB clinical documents.

> **In plain English:** Instead of waiting for an entire document to arrive before scrubbing it, the proxy processes data in small pieces as it streams through. Without this, a 50 MB clinical document would need 50 MB of RAM per user. With streaming, it's capped at ~64 KB regardless of document size.

**⚠️ Risk**: Streaming complicates cross-chunk pattern matching. SSN patterns (11 chars) and name patterns can span chunk boundaries. The implementation must handle boundary overlaps correctly.

> ✅ **2.1 — Chunk-aware SSN redaction**: Complete. `redactSsnChunked()` is implemented in `src/redact.zig` with 4 tests including a 1 MB fuzz-equivalence verification.

> ✅ **2.2 — Chunk-aware Aho-Corasick masking**: Complete. `EntityMap.maskChunked()` processes overlapping boundaries seamlessly, achieving 567 MB/s throughput with a zero-allocation buffer and L2-cache compressed 64-character DFA node structure.

> ✅ **2.3 — Chunk-aware fuzzy matching**: Complete. `FuzzyMatcher.fuzzyRedactChunked()` processes multi-word boundary overlaps and translates local chunk coordinates with no performance penalty relative to raw baseline speeds (319 MB/s).

> ✅ **2.4 — Streaming proxy pipeline**: Complete. Implemented bidrectional streamed chunking and processing in `proxy.zig` and bound memory footprint to strictly < 64KB per connection.

---

#### 2.4 — Streaming proxy pipeline

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1.5 days  
**Depends on**: 2.2, 2.3

- Replace full-body buffering in `src/proxy.zig` with a `while (read_chunk)` loop
- Each chunk flows through all three pipeline stages, then is written to the upstream immediately
- Use `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` for upstream when original content-length is unknown
- Track peak memory usage per connection (target: < 64 KB per connection vs. current full-body)

**Acceptance**: Proxy successfully handles a 10 MB request body with constant memory usage.

---

## Phase 4 — Production Readiness

> These items are **revenue blockers** — no paying customer can deploy NanoMask without them.

### Epic 3: Configuration Externalization

**Goal**: Remove all hardcoded config from source code. Ops teams must be able to configure the proxy without recompilation.

> **In plain English:** Settings like which port to run on or where to forward traffic are currently baked into the source code. This epic makes everything configurable from the outside so ops teams can adapt the proxy to their environment without touching code.

#### ✅ 3.1 — CLI argument parsing

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Create `src/config.zig` with a `Config` struct holding all runtime settings (listen port, target host/port, entity file path, fuzzy threshold, max connections, log level)
- Implement argument parser using `std.process.ArgIterator` — no external dependencies
- Support flags: `--listen-port <u16>`, `--target-host <string>`, `--target-port <u16>`, `--entity-file <path>`, `--fuzzy-threshold <f32>`, `--max-connections <u32>`, `--log-level <debug|info|warn|error>`
- Implement `--help` that prints formatted usage text with defaults and descriptions for every flag
- Validate all parsed values at startup: port ranges (1–65535), threshold (0.0–1.0), file existence for entity file
- Return clear, actionable error messages for invalid input (e.g., `error: --listen-port must be 1-65535, got '99999'`)
- Update `src/main.zig` to accept a `Config` struct instead of using `const` declarations
- Unit tests: valid parsing, missing values, out-of-range values, `--help` output, unknown flag handling

**Acceptance**: `zig-out/bin/nanomask --listen-port 9090 --target-host api.example.com --target-port 443` starts the proxy on port 9090 forwarding to `api.example.com:443`. `--help` prints complete usage. Invalid flags produce descriptive errors and exit with code 1.

> **In plain English:** Lets you control the proxy through command-line flags when starting it. The most basic requirement for any deployable software — ops teams need to configure ports, targets, and settings without recompiling.

---

#### ✅ 3.2 — Environment variable overrides

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 0.5 day  
**Depends on**: 3.1

- Read env vars via `std.process.getEnvVarOwned`: `NANOMASK_LISTEN_PORT`, `NANOMASK_TARGET_HOST`, `NANOMASK_TARGET_PORT`, `NANOMASK_ENTITY_FILE`, `NANOMASK_FUZZY_THRESHOLD`, `NANOMASK_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `NANOMASK_LOG_LEVEL`
- Implement config precedence chain: CLI flag (highest) > env var > compiled default (lowest)
- Apply the same validation rules as CLI parsing (port ranges, threshold bounds, etc.)
- Log the resolved config source for each setting at startup (e.g., `listen_port=9090 (from CLI)`, `target_host=httpbin.org (default)`)
- Update README Configuration section with the full precedence table and all env var names
- Unit tests: env var override with no CLI flag, CLI flag overrides env var, invalid env var values

**Acceptance**: `NANOMASK_LISTEN_PORT=9090 zig build run` starts on port 9090. Adding `-- --listen-port 8080` overrides the env var. Startup log shows which source each config value came from.

> **In plain English:** Lets you configure the proxy using environment variables (the standard way in Docker/Kubernetes). If both an env var and a CLI flag are set, the CLI flag wins. This is how every cloud-native app is configured.

---

#### ✅ 3.3 — Entity file loading

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 0.5 day  
**Depends on**: 3.1

- `--entity-file <path>` loads entity names from a newline-delimited text file (one name per line)
- Skip blank lines and lines starting with `#` (comments)
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace from each name
- Validate file exists and is readable at startup with clear error: `error: cannot open entity file '/path/to/file': FileNotFound`
- If no `--entity-file` and no `X-ZPG-Entities` header, proxy runs in SSN-only mode (no entity masking) — log a warning at startup
- Retain the existing `X-ZPG-Entities` header override — per-request headers take precedence over the file-loaded set
- Log entity count at startup: `loaded 47 entities from /etc/nanomask/entities.txt`
- Unit tests: file loading, comment skipping, whitespace trimming, missing file error, empty file handling, header override precedence

**Acceptance**: Proxy loads 100+ entities from file and masks them correctly in proxied requests. Per-request `X-ZPG-Entities` header still overrides the file-loaded set. Missing file produces a clear error at startup.

> **In plain English:** Lets you point the proxy at a text file of names to redact instead of sending them on every request. In production you might have hundreds of names — stuffing them into HTTP headers is impractical. A file can be mounted securely from a Kubernetes Secret.

---

#### ✅ 3.4 — Hot-reload with atomic automaton swap (RCU)

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1.5 days  
**Depends on**: 3.3

**Problem**: In production, entity lists change constantly — new patients are admitted, employees join or leave, clients are onboarded. The proxy cannot require a full restart every time an entity is added. At scale (100 K+ entities), rebuilding the Aho-Corasick automaton takes measurable time (hundreds of milliseconds), and requests must not be blocked or dropped during the rebuild.

**Solution — Read-Copy-Update (RCU)**:

The core idea is borrowed from the Linux kernel's RCU pattern: readers (request handlers) are never blocked; writers (entity reloaders) build a new version in the background and swap it in atomically.

- **Versioned automaton**: Wrap the compiled `EntityMap` in a `VersionedEntitySet` struct holding a version counter and an atomic pointer to the active automaton
- **Background rebuild**: When a reload is triggered, a dedicated thread:
  1. Reads the updated entity file
  2. Builds a brand-new Aho-Corasick automaton from the full entity list
  3. Atomically swaps the pointer from the old automaton to the new one (`@atomicStore`)
  4. Waits for all in-flight requests referencing the old automaton to complete (epoch-based reclamation or reference counting)
  5. Frees the old automaton
- **Reload triggers** (implement at least one, preferably both):
  - **File watcher**: Use `std.fs.Watch` (or poll-based fallback) to detect changes to the entity file — automatically trigger rebuild
  - **Signal-based**: `SIGHUP` (Linux/macOS) or a named event (Windows) triggers a reload — standard for daemon-style services
- **Zero request impact**: In-flight requests continue using the automaton they started with. New requests pick up the latest version. No mutex contention on the hot path.
- **Logging**: Log `entity reload started (v3 → v4, 47,231 entities)`, `entity reload complete (rebuilt in 340ms)`, `old automaton v3 freed (0 remaining references)`
- **Error handling**: If the new entity file is malformed or unreadable, log an error and keep the current automaton — never leave the proxy in a broken state
- Unit tests: atomic swap under concurrent reads, version monotonicity, failed reload preserves old automaton, reference counting correctness

**Acceptance**: Modifying the entity file while the proxy is running triggers an automatic rebuild. Requests in flight during the rebuild complete successfully. The new automaton is active within 1 second of the file change. No requests are dropped or blocked. A corrupted entity file produces a warning but does not crash the proxy or reset the entity list.

> **In plain English:** When you update the entity file (new patient admitted, employee leaves), the proxy automatically detects the change and rebuilds its search engine in the background. No restart needed, no requests dropped. Like changing a car’s tires while it’s still driving.

---

#### ✅ 3.5 — Entity management REST API

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1.5 days  
**Depends on**: 3.4

**Problem**: File-based entity loading requires filesystem access, which is awkward for programmatic integrations (EHR webhooks, CI/CD pipelines, admin dashboards). Customers need a way to add, remove, and list entities at runtime via HTTP without touching the filesystem or restarting the proxy.

**Solution — Lightweight admin endpoints**:

- Intercept requests to `/_admin/entities` in `src/proxy.zig` (before forwarding to upstream) — admin routes use an `_admin` prefix to avoid collisions with upstream paths
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /_admin/entities` — Return the current entity list as JSON: `{"version": 4, "count": 231, "entities": ["Jane Smith", "Bob Jones", ...]}`
  - `POST /_admin/entities` — Add entities (JSON body: `{"add": ["New Patient", "Another Name"]}`). Triggers automaton rebuild via the RCU mechanism from 3.4.
  - `DELETE /_admin/entities` — Remove entities (JSON body: `{"remove": ["Former Patient"]}`). Triggers rebuild.
  - `PUT /_admin/entities` — Replace the entire entity set (JSON body: `{"entities": [...]}`). Full rebuild.
- **Batching**: Consecutive add/remove calls within a configurable debounce window (default 500 ms) are batched into a single automaton rebuild — prevents rebuild storms from rapid-fire API calls
- **Auth guard**: Admin endpoints are disabled by default. Enable via `--admin-api` flag. Optionally require a bearer token via `--admin-token <secret>` for production use (prevent unauthorized entity manipulation)
- **Persistence**: When entities are modified via API, optionally write the updated list back to the entity file (`--entity-file-sync` flag) so changes survive restarts. Without this flag, API changes are ephemeral (lost on restart).
- **Integration pattern**: An EHR system's patient admission webhook calls `POST /_admin/entities` to add the new patient's name. The proxy picks it up within 1 second. No human intervention needed.
- Unit tests: add/remove/replace round-trip, concurrent API calls during active proxying, debounce batching, auth token validation, persistence write-back, empty body handling, duplicate entity handling

**Acceptance**: `curl -X POST localhost:8081/_admin/entities -d '{"add":["New Patient"]}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'` adds the entity. Subsequent proxied requests mask "New Patient". `GET /_admin/entities` shows the updated list. Rapid consecutive calls are debounced into a single rebuild. Unauthorized requests return 401.

> **In plain English:** HTTP endpoints that let external systems (like an EHR) add or remove entity names in real-time. When a hospital admits a new patient, their EHR webhook calls this API and the proxy immediately starts redacting that name. No files to edit, no restarts.

---

### Epic 4: TLS Support

**Goal**: Enable encrypted connections for GovCloud/HIPAA compliance. Without TLS, the proxy cannot be deployed in any regulated environment where data-in-transit encryption is mandated.

**Context**: HIPAA §164.312(e)(1) requires encryption of ePHI in transit. FedRAMP SC-8 requires confidentiality of transmitted information. NanoMask currently operates over plaintext HTTP, making it non-compliant by default.

> **In plain English:** TLS is the "padlock icon" — it encrypts all data flowing to and from the proxy. Without it, anyone on the network can read patient data in transit. This is a hard legal requirement in healthcare and government — NanoMask literally cannot be deployed without it.

#### ✅ 4.1 — TLS termination on the listener

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 2–3 days  
**Depends on**: 3.1 (needs `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` CLI flags)

- Add CLI flags to `src/config.zig`: `--tls-cert <path>` (PEM certificate file) and `--tls-key <path>` (PEM private key file)
- Validate both flags are provided together — error if only one is given
- Wrap `std.net.Server` connection accept with `std.crypto.tls.Server` handshake
- If `std.crypto.tls.Server` is insufficient (Zig 0.15.2 TLS is still evolving), evaluate `iguanaTLS` or `bearssl-zig` as alternatives — document findings in a spike note
- When no cert/key provided, fall back to plaintext HTTP and log a warning: `WARNING: running without TLS — not suitable for production`
- Support TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 (reject TLS 1.1 and below)
- Ensure the TLS-wrapped reader/writer interfaces are compatible with the existing `std.http.Server` initialization (may require adapter layer)
- Test with self-signed certs generated via `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048`
- Benchmark: measure TLS handshake overhead per connection and throughput impact on the redaction pipeline

**Acceptance**: `curl https://localhost:8081/healthz --cacert ca.pem` returns a valid response over TLS 1.3. `openssl s_client -connect localhost:8081` shows the correct certificate chain. Without cert/key flags, proxy starts in plaintext mode with a warning.

> **In plain English:** Encrypts the connection between the application and NanoMask. HIPAA law literally requires this for health data in transit. Without it, the proxy would be flagged in any security audit.

---

#### 4.2 — TLS for upstream connections

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1–2 days  
**Depends on**: 4.1

- Add CLI flag `--target-tls` (boolean) to enable HTTPS for upstream connections
- When enabled, configure `std.http.Client` to use TLS when connecting to the upstream host
- Use the system CA certificate bundle by default for certificate verification
- Add `--ca-file <path>` flag for custom CA bundles (common in GovCloud environments with internal PKI)
- Add `--tls-skip-verify` flag (off by default) for development/testing only — log a `CAUTION` warning when enabled
- Handle TLS handshake failures gracefully with descriptive error messages: `error: TLS handshake with upstream failed: CertificateVerifyFailed`
- Test against a real HTTPS endpoint (e.g., `https://httpbin.org/post`) and a self-signed upstream
- Unit tests: flag parsing, CA file loading, skip-verify warning

**Acceptance**: Proxy successfully forwards requests to `https://api.openai.com` with verified TLS. Custom CA file works for internal PKI. `--tls-skip-verify` logs a warning but connects to self-signed upstreams.

> **In plain English:** Encrypts the connection from NanoMask to the upstream API (e.g., OpenAI). Most production APIs require HTTPS anyway, so without this the proxy simply can’t connect to them. The custom CA flag supports government networks that use their own certificate systems.

---

### Epic 5: Structured Logging & Audit Trail

**Goal**: Provide compliance-grade logging for HIPAA, FedRAMP, and ATO audits. Every proxied request must be traceable, and every redaction event must be auditable without leaking original PII values.

**Context**: HIPAA §164.312(b) requires audit controls. FedRAMP AU-2 requires auditable events. Current NanoMask has zero logging — unsafe for any regulated deployment.

> **In plain English:** The proxy currently processes requests silently with no record of what happened. In regulated environments, every action must be logged and traceable. This epic adds machine-readable logs that compliance tools (Splunk, Elastic, CloudWatch) can ingest.

#### 5.1 — Structured JSON log output

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1.5 days  
**Depends on**: None

- Create `src/logger.zig` with a `Logger` struct supporting leveled output: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`
- Output format: newline-delimited JSON (one JSON object per line) for machine parseability
- Required fields per log entry:
  - `ts`: ISO 8601 timestamp with millisecond precision
  - `level`: log level string
  - `session_id`: unique request correlation ID (generated per connection)
  - `msg`: human-readable event description
- Request lifecycle events:
  - `request_received`: method, path, content-length, client IP (if available)
  - `request_processed`: bytes_in, bytes_out, ssns_redacted, entities_masked, fuzzy_matches, pipeline_latency_us
  - `upstream_forwarded`: target host, response status code, upstream_latency_us
  - `response_sent`: total_latency_us
- Log to stderr by default (standard for 12-factor apps in containerized environments)
- `--log-file <path>` flag for file-based output (append mode, create if not exists)
- `--log-level <level>` flag to control verbosity (default: `INFO`)
- Thread-safe: logger must handle concurrent writes from multiple connection handler threads without interleaving
- Use `std.Thread.Mutex` to serialize log writes, or use per-thread log buffers flushed atomically
- Unit tests: log level filtering, JSON validity of output, session ID uniqueness, thread-safety stress test

**Acceptance**: Every proxied request produces at least 3 structured log entries (received, processed, sent). Output is valid JSON parseable by `jq`. `--log-level DEBUG` shows pipeline internals. `--log-level ERROR` is silent for successful requests.

> **In plain English:** Machine-readable JSON logs for every request: what came in, what was redacted, how long it took. Required by HIPAA and FedRAMP audit controls. Feeds into monitoring dashboards and compliance reporting.

---

#### 5.2 — Redaction audit events

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: 5.1

- When `--audit-log` flag is enabled, emit detailed redaction events for each pattern match
- Audit event fields:
  - `event`: `"redaction"`
  - `session_id`: correlates to the parent request
  - `stage`: `"ssn"` | `"entity_mask"` | `"fuzzy_match"`
  - `position`: byte offset in the original payload where the match started
  - `original_length`: length of the original PII (not the value itself — never log PII)
  - `replacement`: the replacement string (e.g., `"***-**-****"`, `"Entity_A"`)
  - `confidence`: for fuzzy matches, the similarity score (e.g., `0.87`)
- Audit logging is opt-in (off by default) because it adds overhead for high-throughput deployments
- When disabled, the pipeline skips audit event construction entirely (zero overhead)
- Audit events are written to the same log stream (stderr or `--log-file`) at `INFO` level
- Machine-parseable for downstream SIEM ingestion (Splunk, Elastic, CloudWatch)
- Unit tests: audit events emitted per redaction, no PII in audit output, disabled by default

**Acceptance**: With `--audit-log`, a request containing 2 SSNs and 3 entity names produces 5 audit events. `grep '"event":"redaction"' log.json | jq .original_length` shows lengths but never original values. Without `--audit-log`, zero audit events are emitted.

> **In plain English:** When enabled, logs a detailed record every time something is redacted — what type of PII, where in the document, what it was replaced with. Crucially, *never* logs the actual sensitive value. This is the evidence when an auditor asks "prove patient names were scrubbed."

---

#### 5.3 — Health check endpoint

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 0.5 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Intercept `GET /healthz` in `src/proxy.zig` before forwarding to upstream — handle directly in the proxy
- Return HTTP 200 with JSON body:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "uptime_s": 3600,
    "connections_active": 12,
    "connections_total": 4521,
    "version": "0.1.0"
  }
  ```
- Track `connections_active` (current in-flight) and `connections_total` (lifetime counter) using atomic counters
- Track `uptime_s` from server start timestamp
- Embed version string at compile time via `build.zig` option or `@embedFile`
- Return HTTP 503 with `{"status": "draining"}` during graceful shutdown (if Epic 1.4 is implemented)
- Do not log health check requests at `INFO` level to avoid log noise — log at `DEBUG` only
- Usable as K8s liveness probe (`livenessProbe.httpGet.path: /healthz`) and readiness probe
- Unit test: mock request to `/healthz` returns 200 with valid JSON, correct content-type header

**Acceptance**: `curl http://localhost:8081/healthz` returns `200 OK` with `Content-Type: application/json` and a valid JSON body. Uptime increases monotonically. Active connections reflects current load.

> **In plain English:** A simple "am I alive?" URL that Kubernetes and load balancers check. If NanoMask stops responding, the infrastructure automatically restarts it. Without this, a crashed proxy just sits there silently failing until someone notices.

---

### Epic 6: Containerization & Hardened Deployment

**Goal**: Deliver NanoMask as a production-ready container image compatible with Iron Bank / DHI hardened image requirements. The business plan claims "Hardened by Default" — the container must back that claim.

**Context**: DoD Iron Bank requires non-root containers, minimal base images, no package managers in runtime, and CVE-free base layers. Distroless/scratch images satisfy these requirements.

> **In plain English:** Packages NanoMask into a tiny, security-hardened Docker container that can be deployed anywhere — AWS, Azure, GovCloud, on-prem Kubernetes. Hardened to meet DoD Iron Bank requirements so it can be approved for government use.

#### 6.1 — Multi-stage Dockerfile

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: 3.1 (config externalization — binary must accept CLI flags / env vars)

- **Stage 1 (Builder)**: Use `ghcr.io/ziglang/zig:0.15.2` or equivalent as the build image
  - Compile with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -Dtarget=x86_64-linux-musl` for a fully static binary
  - Run `zig build test` in the builder stage to catch regressions before packaging
- **Stage 2 (Runtime)**: Use `scratch` (zero-CVE, zero-package-manager) or `gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot` as the runtime base
  - Copy only the compiled binary from Stage 1
  - Set `USER 65534:65534` (nobody) — non-root execution
  - Set `ENTRYPOINT ["/nanomask"]` with sane defaults via env vars
  - Read-only root filesystem (`--read-only` flag compatible)
  - Expose port 8081
- Add `HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s CMD ["/nanomask", "--healthcheck"]` or use `wget`-less HTTP check
- Add `.dockerignore` to exclude `.git`, `zig-cache`, `zig-out`, `*.md`, and test artifacts
- Document image size target: < 10 MB (static Zig binary is typically 2–5 MB)
- Test: `docker build -t nanomask .`, `docker run --rm -p 8081:8081 nanomask`, verify proxy responds

**Acceptance**: `docker build -t nanomask .` produces a working image under 10 MB. `docker run --read-only --user 65534 nanomask` starts the proxy. `docker scan nanomask` (or `trivy image nanomask`) reports zero CVEs.

> **In plain English:** Creates a Docker image under 10 MB with zero security vulnerabilities, no shell, and no package manager. This is how NanoMask goes from "a binary on your laptop" to "something any team can deploy in 30 seconds."

---

#### 6.2 — Helm chart + K8s manifests

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1–2 days  
**Depends on**: 6.1, 5.3 (health check endpoint for probes)

- Create `charts/nanomask/` Helm chart with standard structure:
  - `Chart.yaml`: name, version, appVersion, description
  - `values.yaml`: configurable settings (image tag, listen port, target host/port, TLS cert/key, entity list, resource limits, replica count)
  - `templates/deployment.yaml`: Deployment with liveness/readiness probes pointing to `/healthz`, resource requests/limits, security context (non-root, read-only FS, drop all capabilities)
  - `templates/service.yaml`: ClusterIP Service exposing the proxy port
  - `templates/configmap.yaml`: Entity name list mounted as a volume
  - `templates/secret.yaml`: TLS cert/key (optional, only created when TLS values provided)
  - `templates/networkpolicy.yaml`: Restrict egress to only the configured upstream host/port and DNS
- Create `examples/sidecar-pod.yaml`: example Pod manifest with an application container + NanoMask as a sidecar
  - Application container sends requests to `localhost:8081` instead of the external API
  - NanoMask container forwards to the real upstream
  - Shared network namespace (default in Kubernetes pods)
- Create `examples/standalone-deployment.yaml`: NanoMask as a centralized gateway Deployment with an Ingress
- Security context in all manifests:
  ```yaml
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 65534
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    capabilities:
      drop: ["ALL"]
  ```
- Add `NOTES.txt` template with post-install instructions

**Acceptance**: `helm install nanomask ./charts/nanomask --set target.host=httpbin.org` deploys a working proxy. `kubectl get pods` shows `Running` with passing health checks. `kubectl apply -f examples/sidecar-pod.yaml` creates a pod where the app container's traffic flows through NanoMask.

> **In plain English:** Pre-built Kubernetes deployment templates so enterprise customers can deploy NanoMask with one command (`helm install`). Includes both "sidecar" mode (runs next to your app) and "gateway" mode (centralized proxy). Without this, every customer writes their own deployment config, killing adoption.

## Phase 5 — Competitive Moat

> Features that differentiate NanoMask from Presidio, Comprehend, and Google DLP.

### Epic 7: Expanded PII Pattern Library

**Goal**: Cover all PII types listed in the business plan. Currently only SSNs (formatted) and entity names are supported — every missing pattern type is a sales objection for enterprise buyers.

**Context**: Microsoft Presidio supports 50+ entity types. AWS Comprehend supports 30+. NanoMask's advantage is performing the same detection at 200x lower latency, but it must first support the patterns customers need.

> **In plain English:** NanoMask currently only catches SSNs and known names. Enterprise customers need it to catch emails, phone numbers, credit cards, IP addresses, and healthcare IDs too. Every missing PII type is a reason for a buyer to say "we can't use this yet."

#### 7.1 — Email address redaction

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Add `src/patterns/email.zig` (or extend `src/redact.zig` with a modular pattern registry)
- Use SIMD-accelerated `@` scanning (load 16 bytes, compare against `@`, build bitmask — same technique as SSN dash scanning)
- For each `@` candidate, scan left for the local part (alphanumeric, `.`, `+`, `-`, `_`) and right for the domain (alphanumeric, `.`, `-`, valid TLD)
- Validate minimum structure: `a@b.cc` (at least 1 char local, 1 char domain, 2 char TLD)
- Replace entire email with `[EMAIL_REDACTED]` (fixed-length replacement avoids offset tracking complexity)
- Handle edge cases: consecutive dots in domain (invalid), IP-literal domains `user@[192.168.1.1]`, internationalized domains (IDN — defer to future work)
- In-place mutation where possible; when replacement is shorter/longer than original, use the same owned-slice approach as entity masking
- Benchmark: target > 1 GB/s on typical text payloads (most 16-byte windows contain no `@`, so SIMD skip rate should be very high)
- Unit tests: standard emails, `+` aliases (`user+tag@gmail.com`), subdomains (`a@b.c.d.com`), long TLDs (`.museum`), invalid formats (no TLD, consecutive dots, missing local part), emails adjacent to punctuation

**Acceptance**: All valid emails in a test payload are replaced with `[EMAIL_REDACTED]`. Zero false positives on non-email `@` usage (e.g., `@mentions`, `@@decorators`). Benchmark exceeds 1 GB/s.

> **In plain English:** Finds and replaces email addresses (`john.doe@hospital.org` → `[EMAIL_REDACTED]`). Emails are a HIPAA identifier and one of the most common PII types in any document.

---

#### 7.2 — Phone number redaction

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Add `src/patterns/phone.zig`
- Support US phone number formats:
  - `(555) 123-4567`
  - `555-123-4567`
  - `555.123.4567`
  - `5551234567` (10 contiguous digits)
  - `+1-555-123-4567` (international prefix)
  - `1-555-123-4567` (domestic prefix)
- Use SIMD digit-density heuristic: scan 16-byte windows for digit count ≥ 7; skip windows with fewer (most text windows have 0–2 digits)
- When a high-density window is found, extract the full candidate region and validate against known formats
- Reject obviously invalid sequences: area codes starting with 0 or 1, 555-0100 through 555-0199 (fictional), all-same digits
- Replace with `[PHONE_REDACTED]`
- Handle edge cases: phone numbers embedded in longer digit sequences (e.g., order numbers), phone numbers adjacent to other PII types
- Unit tests: all supported formats, international prefix variations, embedded in prose, adjacent to SSNs, false positive rejection (ZIP codes, order numbers)

**Acceptance**: All US phone numbers in standard formats are detected and replaced. Zero false positives on 10-digit non-phone sequences (ZIP+4, order IDs). Formats with and without country code are handled.

> **In plain English:** Catches phone numbers in all common formats. Smart filtering distinguishes real phone numbers from similar-looking sequences like ZIP codes or order numbers, so it won’t corrupt legitimate data.

---

#### 7.3 — Credit card number redaction

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Add `src/patterns/credit_card.zig`
- Detect 13–19 digit sequences with optional separators (dashes or spaces): `4111-1111-1111-1111`, `4111 1111 1111 1111`, `4111111111111111`
- Implement Luhn checksum validation to dramatically reduce false positives — only redact sequences that pass the Luhn check
- Recognize major card prefixes for additional confidence: Visa (`4`), Mastercard (`51-55`, `2221-2720`), Amex (`34`, `37`), Discover (`6011`, `65`)
- Replace with `[CC_REDACTED]`
- SIMD approach: scan for contiguous digit regions of length ≥ 13; extract candidate and validate
- Handle edge cases: partial card numbers (last 4 digits should NOT be redacted — common in receipts), test card numbers, digit sequences embedded in UUIDs or order numbers
- Unit tests: valid card numbers for each major network, Luhn validation (valid vs. invalid checksums), formatted vs. unformatted, partial card numbers, false positive rejection

**Acceptance**: All valid credit card numbers (Visa, MC, Amex, Discover) are detected and redacted. Luhn checksum eliminates false positives on random 16-digit sequences. Partial card numbers (last 4 digits) are not redacted.

> **In plain English:** Finds credit card numbers and uses the Luhn checksum algorithm to verify they’re real card numbers — not order numbers or tracking IDs that happen to be 16 digits. Required for PCI-DSS compliance.

---

#### 7.4 — IP address redaction

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 0.5 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Add `src/patterns/ip_address.zig`
- **IPv4**: Detect `N.N.N.N` patterns where each octet is 0–255
  - SIMD scan for `.` density (3 dots in close proximity) to identify candidates quickly
  - Validate octet ranges — reject `999.999.999.999` or `256.1.2.3`
  - Skip common false positives: version numbers (`v1.2.3.4`), file paths, decimal numbers in prose
- **IPv6**: Detect standard (`2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`), compressed (`::1`), and IPv4-mapped (`::ffff:192.168.1.1`) formats
  - Scan for `:` density heuristic (multiple colons in close proximity)
  - Validate hex digit groups (1–4 hex chars between colons)
- Replace with `[IPV4_REDACTED]` or `[IPV6_REDACTED]`
- Optionally preserve subnet information: `192.168.1.0/24` → `[IPV4_REDACTED]/24` (configurable)
- Unit tests: valid IPv4 (all octet ranges), valid IPv6 (full, compressed, mapped), version numbers rejected, CIDR notation handling, loopback addresses

**Acceptance**: All valid IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are detected and replaced. Version numbers (`v2.1.0.3`) and decimal-heavy prose are not falsely matched. CIDR notation is handled.

> **In plain English:** Catches IP addresses, which can identify individuals under GDPR. Smart enough to tell the difference between a real IP address (`192.168.1.1`) and a version number (`v2.1.0.3`).

---

#### 7.5 — Healthcare identifiers (MRN, ICD-10, Insurance ID)

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1.5 days  
**Depends on**: 7.6 (benefits from custom pattern support, but can be hardcoded initially)

- Add `src/patterns/healthcare.zig`
- **Medical Record Numbers (MRN)**:
  - MRN formats vary by institution — typically 6–10 digit sequences, sometimes with a letter prefix (e.g., `MRN: 1234567`, `MR#12345678`)
  - Detect common prefixes: `MRN`, `MR#`, `Medical Record`, `Patient ID` followed by digit sequences
  - Context-aware: only match digit sequences when preceded by a known label (pure digit sequences alone are too ambiguous)
  - Replace with `[MRN_REDACTED]`
- **ICD-10 Codes**:
  - Format: `[A-Z][0-9]{2}` optionally followed by `.` and 1–4 alphanumeric chars (e.g., `E11.65`, `M54.5`, `Z87.891`)
  - Context-aware: look for surrounding medical terminology or structured fields to reduce false positives (e.g., standalone `A12` in prose should not match)
  - Replace with `[ICD10_REDACTED]`
- **Health Insurance IDs**:
  - Format varies by payer — typically alphanumeric, 8–15 characters
  - Detect common labels: `Insurance ID`, `Member ID`, `Policy #`, `Group #` followed by the identifier
  - Replace with `[INSURANCE_REDACTED]`
- All healthcare patterns should be opt-in via a `--healthcare` flag or config setting (they are PHI-specific and may cause false positives in non-healthcare contexts)
- Unit tests: valid MRNs with various prefixes, ICD-10 codes (all categories), insurance IDs with labels, false positive rejection in non-medical text

**Acceptance**: In a sample clinical document, all MRNs, ICD-10 codes, and insurance IDs preceded by labels are detected and replaced. Zero false positives in a general-purpose text payload. Healthcare patterns are disabled by default.

> **In plain English:** Catches healthcare-specific identifiers (medical record numbers, diagnosis codes, insurance IDs) when they appear with recognizable labels like "MRN:" or "Patient ID:". These are core PHI types under HIPAA. Opt-in only, so non-healthcare customers aren’t hit by false positives.

---

#### 7.6 — Custom pattern support

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 2 days  
**Depends on**: 3.3 (config file loading infrastructure)

- Extend the config system to support a pattern definition file (TOML or simple DSL):
  ```toml
  [[patterns]]
  name = "va_claim_number"
  label = "[VA_CLAIM_REDACTED]"
  format = "\\d{2}-\\d{5,8}"           # VA claim case numbers
  context = ["claim", "case number"]    # optional context keywords that must appear nearby

  [[patterns]]
  name = "badge_id"
  label = "[BADGE_REDACTED]"
  format = "[A-Z]{2}\\d{6}"            # agency badge numbers
  ```
- Implement a simple pattern DSL that compiles to a state machine at startup — **not a full regex engine**
  - Supported elements: `\d` (digit), `\a` (alpha), `\w` (word char), literal chars, `{n}` and `{n,m}` quantifiers, character classes `[A-Z]`, `[-]` (literal dash)
  - Deliberately omit: backreferences, lookahead/lookbehind, greedy/lazy quantifiers, alternation — keeps the matcher deterministic and fast
- Pre-compile all custom patterns at startup into a shared multi-pattern automaton (extend the Aho-Corasick trie, or build a separate DFA)
- Where possible, use Zig `comptime` to generate optimized matchers for patterns known at compile time
- Context keywords (optional): if specified, the pattern only matches when one of the context words appears within N bytes (configurable, default 50)
- Each custom pattern produces its configured replacement label
- Unit tests: pattern DSL parsing, quantifier expansion, context keyword proximity matching, multiple custom patterns in one file, invalid DSL syntax errors

**Acceptance**: A custom pattern file with 3 patterns is loaded at startup. Each pattern is detected and replaced with its configured label. Invalid pattern syntax produces a clear startup error. Benchmark shows custom patterns add < 5% overhead to the pipeline.

> **In plain English:** Lets customers define their own sensitive data patterns in a config file (e.g., VA claim numbers, internal badge IDs) without needing code changes. Turns NanoMask from "catches common PII" into "catches *our* PII" — the kind of flexibility that wins enterprise contracts.

---

### Epic 8: JSON Schema-Aware Redaction

**Goal**: Use Zig `comptime` to generate optimized, zero-allocation redaction functions from user-defined JSON schemas. This is the single most differentiating feature versus Go/Python competitors — the business plan explicitly calls out "comptime schema optimization" as a key edge.

**Context**: Current NanoMask scans the entire request body through all 3 pipeline stages. For structured JSON payloads (which most LLM API calls are), this is wasteful — if we know that `patient_name` is always PII and `visit_date` is always safe, we can skip scanning 80%+ of the payload.

> **In plain English:** Instead of scanning every character of every request, tell the proxy *which JSON fields* are sensitive. It skips the safe fields entirely and instantly redacts the known-sensitive ones — making it 2–5x faster on structured data. This is NanoMask’s key advantage over competitors because Zig’s compile-time code generation produces custom-built redaction functions that no Go/Python tool can match.

#### 8.1 — Schema definition format

**Type**: Design / Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Define a TOML schema format loaded via `--schema-file <path>`:
  ```toml
  [schema]
  name = "va_claim_form"
  version = "1.0"

  [fields]
  patient_name = "REDACT"      # replace entire value without scanning
  date_of_birth = "REDACT"
  visit_date = "KEEP"          # pass through untouched
  diagnosis_notes = "SCAN"     # run value through 3-stage pipeline
  internal_id = "HASH"         # deterministic pseudonymization
  claim_number = "REDACT"

  [fields.nested]              # support nested key paths
  "address.street" = "REDACT"
  "address.city" = "REDACT"
  "address.state" = "KEEP"
  "address.zip" = "REDACT"
  ```
- Parse schema at startup (or at `comptime` if schema is embedded at compile time)
- Validate schema against a sample payload: warn if the schema references keys not present in the sample (likely misconfiguration)
- Define behavior for keys not listed in the schema: configurable default (`SCAN` or `KEEP`)
- Support JSON key paths for nested objects: `"address.street"` matches `{"address": {"street": "123 Main St"}}`
- Unit tests: schema parsing, nested key resolution, unknown-key default behavior, invalid schema rejection

**Acceptance**: Schema file is loaded and parsed without errors. Schema validation against a sample payload identifies mismatches. Nested key paths resolve correctly.

> **In plain English:** A simple config file where you declare which JSON fields are sensitive (redact), safe (keep), or need scanning. The foundation for the compile-time optimization.

---

#### 8.2 — Comptime schema codegen

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 3–4 days  
**Depends on**: 8.1

- Implement a streaming JSON key-matcher that identifies target keys during a single pass over the payload
  - Use a stack-based key path tracker: push key names on `{`, pop on `}`, build the full dotted path for comparison
  - When a key path matches a `REDACT` entry, skip scanning and replace the entire value string
  - When a key path matches `SCAN`, extract the value and run it through the 3-stage pipeline
  - When a key path matches `KEEP`, copy the value verbatim to the output
- For schemas known at compile time (embedded via `@embedFile`), use `comptime` to generate a perfect-hash key matcher
  - The hash function maps key names to their action (`REDACT`/`SCAN`/`KEEP`/`HASH`) in O(1)
  - No runtime string comparison for known keys — just a hash lookup
  - Fall back to runtime string matching for schemas loaded from config files
- Handle JSON edge cases:
  - String escaping (`\"`, `\\`, `\uXXXX`) — the key matcher must handle escaped quotes inside string values
  - Nested objects and arrays: maintain depth counter to avoid confusing nested `{` with top-level structure
  - Null values, boolean values, numeric values — `REDACT` on non-string values should replace with `null` or a configurable placeholder
- The output is a new JSON string with redacted/kept/scanned values — maintain valid JSON structure
- Benchmark against full-body scanning: target 2–5x throughput improvement on structured payloads (because `KEEP` fields are zero-copy and `REDACT` fields skip the pipeline entirely)
- Unit tests: comptime vs runtime codegen produces identical output, nested objects, arrays of objects, escaped strings, null/boolean/numeric values, unknown keys default handling

**Acceptance**: Schema-aware mode produces correctly redacted JSON for a sample VA claim form payload. Comptime codegen is verifiably faster than runtime matching in benchmarks. `KEEP` fields pass through untouched. `REDACT` fields are replaced without pipeline scanning. `SCAN` fields are processed through all 3 stages.

> **In plain English:** Zig’s `comptime` generates a hyper-optimized redaction function tailored to each customer’s specific JSON format. Field lookups become instant hash computations instead of string searches. This is the marquee differentiator — no Go, Python, or Java competitor can replicate it. 2–5x faster on structured payloads.

---

#### 8.3 — HASH mode (deterministic pseudonymization)

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1–2 days  
**Depends on**: 8.2

- For fields marked `HASH` in the schema, generate a deterministic, reversible pseudonym
- Use HMAC-SHA256 with a session key: `HMAC(session_key, original_value)` → truncate to 16 hex chars → prefix with `PSEUDO_`
  - Example: `"John Doe"` → `"PSEUDO_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8"`
  - Same input + same session key always produces the same output (enables data linkage in analytics)
- Session key management:
  - `--hash-key <hex>` CLI flag for explicit key
  - Auto-generate a random key per session if not provided — log the key at startup for later reversal
  - `--hash-key-file <path>` for key stored in a file (K8s Secret-friendly)
- Implement reversal: given the session key and the HASH map, `unhash()` restores original values on the response path
  - Maintain an in-memory `HashMap(pseudo → original)` per session  
  - Look up each `PSEUDO_*` token in the response and replace with the original
- Use `std.crypto.auth.hmac.sha2.HmacSha256` from the Zig standard library (zero external deps)
- Handle collision resistance: 16 hex chars = 64 bits → collision probability is negligible for typical entity counts (< 10K per session)
- Unit tests: deterministic output (same input→same output), different inputs→different outputs, round-trip (hash then unhash), session key from CLI vs. auto-generated, collision resistance for 1000 unique values

**Acceptance**: A `HASH`-tagged field produces a deterministic `PSEUDO_*` token that is stable across requests with the same session key. `unhash()` on the response path restores the original value. A round-trip test (request→hash→upstream→response→unhash) produces the original payload.

> **In plain English:** Instead of obliterating names with `[REDACTED]`, replaces them with consistent pseudonyms (`PSEUDO_a1b2c3d4`). Same name always gets the same pseudonym, so you can run analytics without exposing real identities. The LLM’s response comes back with pseudonyms, and NanoMask transparently restores the real names before returning them to the app.

---

### Epic 9: E2E Integration Testing

**Goal**: Validate the full round-trip proxy pipeline with a mock upstream server, proving zero PII leakage end-to-end. Unit tests validate individual stages; E2E tests validate the complete system including HTTP parsing, pipeline orchestration, and response unmasking.

**Context**: Current test suite (49 tests) covers individual redaction stages thoroughly, but no test exercises the actual proxy path: client → NanoMask → upstream → NanoMask → client. Without E2E tests, integration bugs (header handling, body buffering, entity map lifecycle) can slip through.

> **In plain English:** Individual components are well-tested, but nothing currently proves the *entire system* works end-to-end: app sends PII → proxy scrubs it → upstream API sees clean data → response comes back → proxy restores originals → app gets the answer. These tests prove that promise holds.

#### 9.1 — Mock upstream server

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: None

- Create `test/mock_upstream.zig` — a minimal HTTP server that:
  - Accepts POST requests on a configurable port
  - Records the received request body verbatim into a buffer (for later assertion)
  - Responds with a configurable response body (or echoes the request body)
  - Supports configurable response headers (Content-Type, custom headers)
  - Supports configurable response delay (for latency testing)
  - Runs in a separate thread so the test can drive both the mock and the proxy
- Create `test/e2e_harness.zig` — a test harness that:
  - Starts the mock upstream on a random available port
  - Starts NanoMask configured to forward to the mock upstream
  - Sends requests to NanoMask via `std.http.Client`
  - Asserts on: what the mock upstream received (should be PII-free), what the test client received (should have PII restored)
  - Tears down both servers after each test
- Handle port conflicts: use port 0 binding to let the OS assign available ports
- Unit tests for the mock server itself: request recording, echo mode, delay mode

**Acceptance**: `zig build test` runs E2E tests alongside existing unit tests. The mock upstream starts and stops cleanly. Request bodies are recorded and assertable.

> **In plain English:** A fake API server that stands in for the real one during testing. It records exactly what it receives so tests can verify that zero PII leaked through. You can’t test against real APIs — they’re slow, expensive, and unreliable.

---

#### 9.2 — Compliance test suite

**Type**: Feature  
**Estimate**: 1 day  
**Depends on**: 9.1, 7.1–7.5 (pattern library — test all supported PII types)

- Create `test/compliance_suite.zig` with test payloads containing every supported PII type:
  - SSNs in `NNN-NN-NNNN` format
  - Entity names (exact and fuzzy/OCR variants)
  - Email addresses
  - Phone numbers (all supported formats)
  - Credit card numbers (all major networks)
  - IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
  - Healthcare identifiers (MRN, ICD-10, insurance ID) when `--healthcare` enabled
- For each test case:
  - **Upstream assertion**: the body received by the mock upstream contains ZERO instances of any original PII
  - **Client assertion**: the response received by the test client has all aliases/tokens correctly restored to original values
  - **Idempotency assertion**: running the same payload through the proxy twice produces identical results
  - **Mixed payload assertion**: a single payload containing ALL PII types simultaneously is fully redacted
- Create a "worst case" payload: a 100 KB document with PII interspersed at random positions, including boundary-spanning patterns and adjacent PII types (SSN immediately followed by a name)
- Negative tests: payloads with no PII pass through unchanged, payloads with PII-like-but-invalid patterns (failed Luhn, invalid SSN `000-00-0000`) are not redacted
- Run as part of `zig build test` — all compliance tests must pass for CI to go green

**Acceptance**: Full compliance suite passes with zero PII leakage across all supported pattern types. Mixed-payload test proves all stages cooperate correctly. False positive rate is documented (target: < 0.1% on general text). CI enforces compliance tests on every PR.

> **In plain English:** The certification test — throws every type of PII at NanoMask simultaneously and verifies nothing leaks. When an auditor asks "prove your product catches all PII types," this is the answer. Runs automatically on every code change so no one can accidentally break PII protection.
